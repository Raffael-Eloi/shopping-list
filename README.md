# Shopping List

In our shopping list system, customers have the convenience of browsing a wide range of products. They can view product details, make purchases, or add items to their shopping cart with ease. What sets our system apart is the integration of promotions, all managed by the store manager. <br><br>
One of the features of our system is the ability for customers to rate the products they've purchased. This means that after making a purchase, customers can provide feedback by assigning a rating and leaving a review. This valuable feedback helps other shoppers make informed decisions and provides insights to both customers and the store manager.<br>
When a customer rates a product, their feedback is displayed for other users who have also purchased that item. This way, shoppers can view the collective ratings and reviews from fellow customers, offering a comprehensive overview of the product's quality and popularity.<br><br>
When a customer makes a purchase, they receive a prompt email notification confirming the details of their order, ensuring a seamless shopping experience. Additionally, our inventory management feature empowers the store manager to stay informed about stock levels. They receive email alerts when a product is running low, allowing for timely restocking and ensuring that customers always find their desired items in stock.<br>
